This is my final project for CS50's Introduction to Computer Science Course.

In 1880 Ebbinghaus made a few experiments that showed "the forgetting curve". This curve shows how fast you can forget content you have studied.

So the idea for this APP was to apply that experiment into a dinamic TODO list, where you add what book and chapter you have read and then it automatically adds those books to a TODO tab when its time to revise that book, in order to hack the forgetting curve :)

For a starter, when you first add a book that you have read , it will go to the TODO list after 24 hours , after that it will go into the TODO list again after a week , and after that it will go to the TODO list after one month.

If you revised the book those 3 times , It will go to the DONE tab where all the books you have studied are displayed.

This is my Android APP. Thanks for reading.
